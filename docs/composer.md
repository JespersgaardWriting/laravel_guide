[Main Composer Docs](https://getcomposer.org/)

Composer is key to PHP moving foward and anyone who wants to work with PHP, Oo and Laravel.

In the pages that come we will use it again and again and cover the basics.

The Main Composer Docs is really good to read as well.

You will be running it inside your vagrant box. Sometimes I do it outside the box for speed reasons but inside is easiest as Laravel will do post steps as well.

Speaking of speed it can be slow. Try when adding new packages try

~~~
composer require vendor/packages --dev
~~~

This will save it to your composer.json for you.
