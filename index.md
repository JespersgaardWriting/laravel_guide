# Laravel Guide from Testing to Deploy

## Intro

I hope to do here what [Michael Hartl](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter) did for me and rails.

I will, just like he did go from the very basics all the way to deployment.

Why bother with this when Jeffery Way rocks and has Laracast? Good question. For me the guide Michael Hartl offered got me into Rails, into MVC, into ORM, TDD etc. And sure Jeffery Way could of too but the guide/written format seems to do more for me thant videos. Together though they are a great combination and I will link to Laracast as much as possible cause I have watched tons of them.
